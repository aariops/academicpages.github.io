Hello,

I'm Rute Correia, a Communication PhD student at [ISCTE-IUL](https://iscte-iul.pt/).

My prethesis is **Community Radio Stations Sustainability Model: An Open Source Solution**. My work will look into how open source can be integrated in community radio stations in terms of content creation, technology operation and community management to provide a sustainable broadcast practice. You can read the current abstract [on the blog](/posts/2018-10-18-blog-post-3.md).

Other research (and personal) interests revolve around the [open movement](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/), open content and copyleft, remix studies, digital rights and activism, participatory social structures, radio art and experimental forms of radio production.

I am also an experienced radio person, having presented and produced various shows and features, as well as managed music and communication departments at different stations. For nearly a decade, I have been hosting and producing **[White Market Podcast](https://www.whitemarketpodcast.eu/)**, an advocate podcast about free music and free culture.

I currently host and produce the morning show at [Oxigénio 102.6](http://oxigenio.fm/).
