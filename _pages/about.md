Hello,

I'm Rute Correia, a Communication PhD student at [ISCTE-IUL](https://iscte-iul.pt/).

My prethesis is **Community Radio Stations Sustainability Model: An Open Source Solution**.
My work will draw upon case studies to look into how open source can be integrated in community radio stations in terms of content creation, technology operation and community management to provide a sustainable broadcast practice and, thus, ensuring that such social structures remain faithful to their mission of inclusiveness and empowerment through participation. You can read the current abstract [on the blog](/posts/2018-10-18-blog-post-3.md).

Other research (and personal) interests revolve around the [open movement](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/), open content and copyleft, remix studies, digital rights and activism, participatory social structures, radio art and experimental forms of radio production.

I am also an experienced radio person, having presented and produced various shows and features, as well as managed music and communication departments at different stations. For nearly a decade, I have been hosting and producing **[White Market Podcast](https://www.whitemarketpodcast.eu/)**, an advocate podcast about free music and free culture.

I currently host and produce the morning show at [Oxig√©nio 102.6](http://oxigenio.fm/).
